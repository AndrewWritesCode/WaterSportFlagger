first make sure the USB is named: SamsungUSB

Follow these steps to make it mountable:

sudo mkdir /mnt/SamsungUSB
(plug in the USB)
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/SamsungUSB
(Now check that the USB has been mounted using ls)

Now use sudo crontab -e

Add the following to the crontab file:

@reboot sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/SamsungUSB
@reboot sudo python3 /home/pi/Scripts/OtterSpotter/main.py &

Now use sudo raspi-cofig to switch the pi to command line mode
